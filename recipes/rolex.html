        <h2>Rolex</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Ugandan Rolex isn't a luxury watch; it's Uganda's beloved street food: a chapati (flatbread) wrapped around a fresh egg omelet with mixed vegetables like tomatoes, onions, and cabbage, forming a savory, handheld meal known for its name "rolled eggs".</p>
        <p>Found on every street corner, this affordable, quick, and filling dish is a cultural staple enjoyed by all, from students to workers, for breakfast, lunch, or a snack, often with added fillings like meat.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapati: A soft, unleavened flatbread. While store-bought versions work, authentic street-style chapatis are made from wheat flour, water, salt, and oil.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Typically 2 per Rolex, though more can be used for a heartier meal.</li>
            <li>Onions: Finely chopped or sliced rings (usually red onions).</li>
            <li>Tomatoes: Thinly sliced or diced for juiciness.</li>
            <li>Cabbage: Thinly shredded and added either into the egg mix or as a fresh garnish before rolling.</li>
            <li>Salt: Used to season the eggs and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil: Essential for frying the omelet and the chapati. </li>
            <li>Vegetables: Bell peppers (hoho), grated carrots, or fresh coriander (cilantro).</li>
            <li>Proteins: Shredded chicken, minced beef, or sausages.</li>
            <li>Extras: Sliced avocado, cheese, or minced garlic.</li>
            <li>Seasoning: Black pepper or small green chilies for a spicy kick. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables: Thinly slice the onion and tomatoes, and shred the cabbage. If using optional ingredients like chilies or cilantro, chop them finely.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs: In a bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir in all the prepared vegetables.</li>
            <li>Warm the chapati: Heat a non-stick pan or skillet over medium heat. Warm the chapati on both sides for about a minute in total to make it soft and pliable. Set it aside and cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Cook the omelet: In the same pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture and swirl the pan to distribute it evenly over the surface.</li>
            <li>Combine the chapati and egg: Once the bottom of the egg mixture is set, place the warmed chapati directly on top of the omelet. Press down gently so they stick together.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook: Carefully flip the chapati and egg over so the chapati side is now on the hot surface of the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the chapati is lightly browned and the egg is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Roll and serve: Transfer the chapati and omelet onto a clean plate. Starting from one edge, roll it up tightly into a log shape to form the "Rolex".</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Slice the Rolex in half or serve it whole, immediately while still warm. It can be wrapped in foil or paper for an authentic street-food experience. </li>
        </ol>
